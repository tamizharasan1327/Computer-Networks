Computer networks are interconnected systems that enable communication and resource sharing among multiple devices, such as computers, servers, and peripherals. These networks can range from small-scale setups like local area networks (LANs) to large-scale global systems like the internet. Networks operate using established protocols, such as TCP/IP, to ensure reliable data transmission and efficient communication. They play a critical role in modern life, supporting activities like online collaboration, data sharing, and internet access. Key components of computer networks include routers, switches, and network cables or wireless connections, which facilitate data flow and connectivity. Advances in technologies like 5G, cloud computing, and IoT have further expanded the scope and importance of computer networks in various domains, including business, healthcare, and education.
